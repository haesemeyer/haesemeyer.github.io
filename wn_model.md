<!-- The question then becomes how temperature influences swim initiation or more specifically:

1. Over what timescale does larval zebrafish sample temperature information?
2. If temperature changes over time how does this influence swim initiation?

The first question is related to accuracy and reaction time. The faster larval zebrafish
"completes a measurement" the faster it can react to changes in the environment. However,
measurements are rarely perfect and longer sampling times likely improve accuracy. Through
precise temperature stimulation and behavioral modeling in freely swimming larval zebrafish
we could establish that:

1. Larval zebrafish sample temperature over the fast timescale of 0.5 seconds before deciding
to initiate swims, allowing them to react quickly to changes in their environment.
2. Within this time interval both absolute temperature and perceived changes in heat
influence swimming.

The latter point effectively means that larval zebrafish react especially quickly to changes
in temperature followed by slight adaptation. This strategy may allow them to quickly try
and escape an area of higher temperature while conserving energy in case this is not
immediately possible. -->
