Whether we are crossing a street or evaluating the temperature of our drink our brain
constantly senses the environment, processes relevant information and hopefully produces
appropriate reactions to the environment.  
This feat relies on the coordinated interplay of many critical building blocks. Sensory 
organs such as our eyes or temperature receptors in our skin need to detect features of
our surroundings. This information has to be accurately relayed to our brain which then
integrates the sensory information to "make sense of it all".  
At the same time the meaning of sensory input is generally not absolute. A desirable
temperature for a cup of coffee is generally not considered appropriate for a glass of
beer. Simiarly strategies for crossing a street differ whether traffic runs on the right
or left. The brain therefore needs to take context into account when processing sensory cues.

It is my overall goal to understand how groups of neurons in the brain interact to encode
and interpret information about the world in order to generate appopriate behaviors.
